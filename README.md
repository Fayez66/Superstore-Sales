## Project Overview
This project presents a thorough analysis of Superstore sales data from 2014 to 2017. The dataset, provided as an Excel file, includes detailed information on orders, customers, products, and sales performance. Our goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to extract actionable business insights and support data-driven decision-making.

### Dataset Features
- Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode
- Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment
- Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region
- Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name
- Sales

## Objectives

This project aims to answer key business questions through data-driven analysis and visualization. The main objectives are:

### 1. Sales Analysis
- Determine the total sales amount by region, state, and city.
- Identify top-performing products, categories, and sub-categories in terms of sales.
- Analyze seasonal sales trends to pinpoint periods of peak and low sales throughout the year.
- Examine the distribution of orders across different sales categories.
- Calculate revenue generated by each product category and sub-category.

### 2. Customer Segmentation
- Segment customers by type (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) and analyze their characteristics.
- Identify which customers contribute most to overall sales and order volume.
- Explore how customer segments are distributed across different seasons.
- Assess order frequency for each customer segment.

### 3. Product Performance
- Track the number of products sold over time (year, month, day).
- Identify which product categories generate the most sales over time.
- Calculate the total number of products sold.
- Determine the average order frequency across all products.
